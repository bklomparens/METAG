# Metagenomic analysis SLURM scripts
The following SLURM scripts align with the workflow specified in the Eggleston Lab Google Drive: "Metagenomic Analysis: Protocol, Code, and Workflow"
For each step that uses a slurm script, the corresponding script name is highlighted in light blue and is in this repository.
Please note the comments in each script that should provide more explanation behind each step and highlight any key steps!
Throughout these scripts, each individual sample read that starts as a .fastq file is named file1, file2, and so on. Be sure to change this name to match the names of your actual files when running these scripts!
